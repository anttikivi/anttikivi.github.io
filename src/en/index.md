Hello, I’m _Antti Kivi_.

I’m a software developer, entrepreneur, student, and communications adviser. On
my website (this one), I share my thoughts and projects.

Besides the works done by [Visiosto](https://www.visiosto.fi/en) where I create
web applications as an entrepreneur, I mostly work on open-source project. You
can find some my works on [GitHub](https://github.com/anttikivi). I’m currently
creating [Reginald](https://github.com/get-reginald/reginald), the personal
workstation valet.

My day job revolves around politics and social issues as the communications
adviser of
[National Union of University Students in Finland](https://syl.fi/en), the
advocate for university students in Finland.

In addition to all this, I study social sciences and science at the University
of Helsinki and administrative sciences at Tampere University.
