Hello, I’m _Antti Kivi_.

I’m a software developer. I build web applications as an entrepreneur at
[Visiosto](https://www.visiosto.fi/en). We specialize in accessible applications
and inclusive services.

In my spare time, I mainly work on personal projects, most of which are open
source. You can find some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/anttikivi).

On this site, you’ll find my writings and projects.

<!-- Right now, I’m creating [Reginald](https://github.com/anttikivi/reginald), the personal workstation valet. -->

For my day job, I’m the communications adviser at the
[National Union of University Students in Finland](https://syl.fi/en).
