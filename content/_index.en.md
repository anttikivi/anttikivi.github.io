Hello, I’m _Antti Kivi_, a software developer.

I build accessible interfaces and inclusive digital services as one of the
proprietors of [Visiosto](https://www.visiosto.fi/en/). In my spare time, I work
on personal projects that you can find on
[GitHub](https://github.com/anttikivi).

For my day job, I’m the communications adviser at the
[National Union of University Students in Finland](https://syl.fi/en).
